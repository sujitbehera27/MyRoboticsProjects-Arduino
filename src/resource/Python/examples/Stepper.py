# adding an event listener for stepper events
# currently a stop event is only implemented
# however, a position change event could be possible
# not sure how much latency there would be on a 57K line
# probably a good idea - the event in this case is just
# handled by printing it - both other services could handle
# it differently - e.g. if stepper < threshold - do something
